SQL:

create database classroom;                         #create a new database
use classroom;                                     #using created database to enter the values
CREATE TABLE Student (
 student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,                       #adding first column name Student_id as primary key
    name VARCHAR(50),                              #adding Column 2 name VARCHAR(50)means characters values
    class VARCHAR(10),
    age INT
);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES                         #inserting values into table based on columns created 
(1, 'Ravi', '10A', 15),
(2, 'Sita', '10A', 14),
(3, 'Arjun', '9B', 14);
SELECT * FROM Student;                            #showing complete table 
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE class = '10A';        #shows the table by where condition 
UPDATE Student SET age = 16 WHERE student_id = 1; #setting the student age by where condition 
DELETE FROM Student WHERE student_id = 3;         #Delete the row by where condition 
ALTER TABLE Student                               #adding new column to already existing table
ADD marks INT;                                    #adding column(INT)
UPDATE Student SET marks = 85 WHERE student_id = 1;#updating student marks based on primary key in where condition
UPDATE Student SET marks = 90 WHERE student_id = 2;
select *from Student limit 2;                     # top rows in table will fetch 
select *from Student order by marks desc limit 2; #selectiing top 2 students by marks 


AGGREGATION:
->Order by ->Sorting after the table 
->Sum(marks)->Sum of marks before the table 
->AVG(marks)-> Avg the marks
->MAX(marks)->max marks
->MIN(marks)->Min marks
->COUNT(*)->Count the number of values in table 

#AND
select *from Student where student_id=2 and marks=90
#OR
select *from Student where student_id=3 or marks=90

DELETE KEYWORD:
*Removes selected rows
*Uses WHERE condition
*Can be rolled back (if transaction)
*Table structure remains
EX:DELETE FROM Student WHERE student_id = 3;


TRUNCATE KEYWORD:
*Removes ALL rows and remains the table
*Cannot use WHERE
*Very fast
*Cannot be rolled back
*Table structure remains
EX:TRUNCATE TABLE Student;

DROP KEYWORD:
*Deletes entire table
*Data + structure both removed
*Cannot be rolled back
ex: DROP TABLE Student;


Group By:
GROUP BY in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns and then apply aggregate functions on each group.
EX:select Course,Avg(marks) from Student group by Course
EX:Select Course,age,avg(marks),max(marks) from Student Group by Course,age;

SQL constraints:
1)primary Key:
->Combination of NOT NULL + UNIQUE
->Uniquely identifies each row in a table
->Only one primary key per table
EX:CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50)
);


2)NOT NULL:Ensures a column cannot have NULL values
EX:CREATE TABLE Student (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

3)CHECK:
Ensures values satisfy a specific condition
EX:CREATE TABLE Student (
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);


4)Default: Sets a default value if no value is provided
EX:CREATE TABLE Account (
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active'
);

5)FOREIGN KEY:Links one table to another

Maintains referential integrity
EX:CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(emp_id)
);

6)AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL):Automatically increases numeric values (mostly for primary keys)
EX:CREATE TABLE Product (
    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50)
);

2️⃣ UNIQUE:Ensures all values in a column are different
EX:CREATE TABLE User (
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);


JOINS in SQL
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column (usually a Primary Key ↔ Foreign Key).

1.inner join:Returns only matching records from both tables.
EX:SELECT t1.student_id, t1.name, t2.subject, t2.marks
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.student_id = t2.student_id;

2.Left Join:👉 Returns ALL records from left table + matching from right table.(A+AnB)
SELECT t1.student_id, t1.name, t2.subject, t2.marks
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.student_id = t2.student_id;

3.Right Join:👉 Returns ALL records from right table + matching from left table.(B+BnA)
SELECT t1.student_id, t1.name, t2.subject, t2.marks
FROM table1 t1
RIGHT JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.student_id = t2.student_id;

4.FULL JOIN:👉 Returns ALL records from both tables.(A+B+(AnB))
SELECT t1.student_id, t1.name, t2.subject, t2.marks
FROM table1 t1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.student_id = t2.student_id;

EXAMPLE:
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    product VARCHAR(50),
    amount INT
);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES
(1, 'Aman', 'Delhi'),

select *from customers;
select *from orders ;
/*show customers name ,product and amount :*/
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    o.product,
    o.amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
/*shows customer name and where city is delhi and product name using inner join*/
select

inner join orders o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
where city='Delhi';
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
/*show all customers even they have no orders*/
select 
c.customer_name,

left join orders o

/*show all orders even they have no customers*/
select

right join orders o

FROM orders o
right join customers c

 join orders o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id;
select *from orders where amount between 25000 and 100000;

*Difference Between Where and Having with Example:
Difference Between WHERE and HAVING in SQL
Key Differences: WHERE vs HAVING
Criteria	            WHERE Clause	                                                   HAVING Clause
Filtering Level	          Filters individual rows	                                        Filters groups of rows
Aggregate Functions	Cannot use aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)	           Can use aggregate functions
Execution                 Order	Applied before GROUP BY	                                               Applied after GROUP BY
SQL Statements	         Used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE	                                      Used only with SELECT
Performance	          Faster (filters data earlier)	                                  Slower (filters after aggregation)

1. WHERE Clause (Filtering Individual Rows)
Example:

To find orders where the amount of an individual product is greater than 100:

SELECT CustomerID, ProductID, Amount
FROM Orders
WHERE Amount > 100;

Explanation:

The WHERE clause filters each row separately

Orders with Amount ≤ 100 are removed

Filtering happens before any grouping

2. HAVING Clause (Filtering Grouped Data)
Example:

To find customers whose total order amount is greater than 500:

SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSpent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING SUM(Amount) > 500;

Explanation:

GROUP BY groups orders by CustomerID

HAVING filters groups, not individual rows

Aggregate function SUM() is allowed in HAVING


SUB QUERY in SQL : Query Inside the Query
*One question depends on another question 
*Subquery is a query where results are read by another query 
EX:select emp_name,emp_salary from employees where emp_salary>(select avg(emp_salary) from employees)
EX:select customer_id,customer_name from customers where customer_id in (select customer_id from orders)
EX:select customer_id,customer_name from customers where customer_id not in (select customer_id from orders)
EX:SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE amount > (
        SELECT AVG(amount)
        FROM orders
    )
);

Transaction in SQL (Simple Definition)

A transaction in SQL is a group of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work.
👉 (Either all statements succeed or none of them are applied.)
Real-Life Example (Bank Transfer 💰)

If money is transferred:

Amount is debited from one account

Amount is credited to another account

✔ Both must happen
❌ If one fails, everything should be undone
EX:start transaction;
update bank_acc set balance=balance-500 where acc_id=1;
commit ;

INDEXING:
Indexing in SQL is a technique used to speed up data retrieval from a table.
An index works like a book index — it helps the database find data faster without scanning the whole table.

🔹 Why Indexing is Needed?
Without index → Full table scan (slow ❌)
With index → Direct access to data (fast ✅)

Syntax:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name(column_name);

EX:create index idx_name on customers(customer_name);
select customer_name from customers where customer_name='vikas';

Drawbacks:
don't use it for small data(tables)
it occupies the space in database
insert ,update delete become slow
