SQL:

create database classroom;                         #create a new database
use classroom;                                     #using created database to enter the values

    class VARCHAR(10),
    age INT
);

ALTER TABLE Student                               #adding new column to already existing table

select *from Student limit 2;                     # top rows in table will fetch 
select *from Student order by marks desc limit 2; #selectiing top 2 students by marks 


AGGREGATION:
->Order by ->Sorting after the table 
->Sum(marks)->Sum of marks before the table 
->AVG(marks)-> Avg the marks
->MAX(marks)->max marks
->MIN(marks)->Min marks
->COUNT(*)->Count the number of values in table 

#AND
select *from Student where student_id=2 and marks=90
#OR
select *from Student where student_id=3 or marks=90

DELETE KEYWORD:
*Removes selected rows
*Uses WHERE condition
*Can be rolled back (if transaction)
*Table structure remains
EX:DELETE FROM Student WHERE student_id = 3;


TRUNCATE KEYWORD:
*Removes ALL rows and remains the table
*Cannot use WHERE
*Very fast
*Cannot be rolled back
*Table structure remains
EX:TRUNCATE TABLE Student;

DROP KEYWORD:
*Deletes entire table
*Data + structure both removed
*Cannot be rolled back
ex: DROP TABLE Student;


Group By:
GROUP BY in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns and then apply aggregate functions on each group.
select Course,Avg(marks) from Student group by Course
Select Course,age,avg(marks),max(marks) from Student Group by Course,age;
